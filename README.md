# **HACK TO GAIN ACCESS**

Frontend and Backend are the two most important words used in web development. They are very important for web development but are much different from each other. They need to work as a single unit for better functionality of website.

**Frontend development**

Front end development is the part of web development that codes and creates front end elements of a website. The front end of a website are things which can be seen and are accessible by the user such as buttons, text etc. A front end developer is responsible for everything we see and works to enhance the user experience. They help to create the overall design in addition to debugging and using static code analysis.The main front end coding languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**HTML**

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. It is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language and it defines the link between the web pages.

**CSS**

Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS is a simply designed language used to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows us to apply styles to web pages and it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each.

**JavaScript**

JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is used for enhancing the functionality of a website to run cool games and web-based software.

**Front End Frameworks and Libraries**

**AngularJS**

AngularJs is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. It is an open-source project which can be free.

**Bootstrap**

Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.

**JQuery**

jQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.

**SASS**

SASS is the most reliable, mature, and robust CSS extension language. It is used to extend the functionality of an existing CSS of a site including everything from variables, inheritance, and nesting with ease.

**Flutter**

Flutter is an open-source UI development SDK managed by google. It is powered by Dart programming language. It builds performant and good-looking natively complied applications for mobile (Ios, Android), web, and desktop from a single code base. The key selling point of flutter is flat development is made easier, expressive, and flexible UI and native performance. In march 2021 flutter announce Flutter 2 which upgrades flutter to build release applications for the web, and the desktop is in beta state

**Backend development**

Back end development, as like the name, occurs at the back of a website. Compared to front end development, it focuses on customer-facing products and programs, back end development addresses, server-side web application logic and integration. Back end developers write code to help a database and application communicate. The backend developers works on things that the users cant see. They are in charge of the back end of a website, which includes servers, databases, and applications.Back end development requires more advanced programming languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby, and Python.

**Java**

Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available

**PHP**

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.

**Ruby**

Ruby is an open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

**Python**

Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
